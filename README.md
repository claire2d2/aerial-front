### About this project

This is my first Full Stack project, joining my passion for coding and aerial arts! I developed this during my Ironhack web development bootcamp in under two weeks.
This is my frontend repo, you can access my backend repo [here](https://github.com/claire2d2/aerial-backend/)

### Basic functionnalities :

- Navigate through different figures of different disciplines (focus on pole dance for the moment)
- Sort by level and search for a specific figure

#### For logged in users:

- Basic authentification with the possibility to change password once logged in
- Keep tabs on each figure with the possibility to favorite them, and give them a status ("training" or "mastered", for example)
- Keep a journal of progress logs for each figure, with the possibility to add a picture to it
- Propose transitions to go into and out of a figure, and view other users' propositions
- Like the transitions you like the most, effectively pushing the most popular transitions at the top of the list!
- Generate a combo based on different criteria you have given (number of figures, and filters)
- Create a combo by searching for every figure individually
- Save those combos, and find them all in one place
- Edit saved combos and add comments to them, so that you don't forget a thing!
- Set user preferences for dark mode
